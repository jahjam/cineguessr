# CineGuessr 🎬

#### ⚠️ Please note: CineGuessr only has one test film currently due to waiting for artist to draw custom cards 

A guessing game, where, based on hand-illustrated cards which appear on a daily basis, the player must guess the film
correctly before their lives run out.

This was a project I made at the end of my time at Northcoders on their software development bootcamp. It was meant to
serve as a method of consolidating all the skills I honed/learned whilst there. Other than TDD, which I felt wasn't
necessary on this project due to it not being complex enough, I used everything I used on the bootcamp here. 

The result is fully functioning movie guessing game, that uses Supabase to track user stats. You can only play once a
day and the logic is set up so that no movie can ever be selected twice (unless all movies have already been used
then the whole game resets to use them again).
